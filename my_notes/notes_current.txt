Questions:
	in the urls.py there is are API routes are these ONLY used for fetch requests? 

There are 4 total urls:
	one for the index
		literally everything happens here
		including all the buttons you see at the top
			inbox
			compose
			sent
			archived
	one for the login page
	one for the logout page
	one for the register page

TODOs:
- Create emails using the API
	 - in inbox.html, I need to grab all fields from the to, subject, body fields
	 - then I need to create a json from those fields
	 - then send the json in a post request
	 	- look at the project documentation for more info

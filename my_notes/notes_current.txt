Questions:
	in the urls.py there is are API routes are these ONLY used for fetch requests? 

There are 4 total urls:
	one for the index
		literally everything happens here
		including all the buttons you see at the top
			inbox
			compose
			sent
			archived
	one for the login page
	one for the logout page
	one for the register page

TODOs:
/- Create emails using the API
/	 - in inbox.html, I need to grab all fields from the to, subject, body fields
/	 - then I need to create a json from those fields
/	 - then send the json in a post request
/	 	- look at the project documentation for more info 

/- View Email 
/	- Need to add button to inbox page
/		- This button needs to send get request 

/- Emails are sending as read for some reason
/	- Fix this
/	- Might also need to check if this actually happens because this showed up when I sent to the same email I was sending to
/	- So login as some other user and send an email to moon and login as moon and see if it affects you
		- Turns out this was it, sending from mars to moon creates an unread email in moon's inbox

/- Reply to emails
/	- create a copy of "compose_email()" function that is autopopulated with
/		- Re: + subject line EXCEPT when the subject begins with "Re: "!!
/		- sender as recipient 

- Need to figure a way to get emails for the specific inboxes
	- I think what I need to do is when the user clicks a button, run the exact same code I am using for the inbox 
	- but instead use an if statement to filter if the json data that is returned (in the foreach loop)
	- Ones that don't meet criteria (checked through an if statement) do not get displayed
	- I need to do this for the main inbox as well

	- Inbox
		- filter so that archived emails do not show up
	
	- Sent 
		- not sure how I'm going to do this, I have to get emails where the user is the recipient FIRST
		- after that it's easy, just have to display them like all others

	- Archived
		- basically the opposite of the inbox where it only displays emails with archived flag

- View Email View
	- If archived, there needs to be an unarchive button ONLY
	- If sent, make sure no buttons
	- If unarchived, then make sure there is a reply button AND and an archive button
		- Need to add a button to reply 
		- Need to add a button to archive
